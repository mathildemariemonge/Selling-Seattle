# Selling Seattle

Welcome to Ilkay and Mathilde's project on building a linear regression model for the Seattle housing market! In this project, we will be exploring the factors that affect housing prices in Seattle and using that knowledge to create a predictive model that can estimate the prices of homes in the area. By analyzing data on various features such as location, size, age, and amenities of properties sold in Seattle, we will build a model that can help home buyers and sellers make more informed decisions. Through this project, we hope to gain insights into the Seattle housing market and provide valuable information to those interested in buying or selling property in the area.

Day 1: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Gather and load the data into a notebook
Explore the data to understand its structure, size, and quality
Identify missing values, outliers, and anomalies
Visualize the distributions of numerical features and relationships between variables
Formulate initial hypotheses about the factors that drive housing prices in Seattle

Day 2: Data Cleaning

Clean and preprocess the data to prepare it for analysis
Remove typos and inconsistent values
Convert and correct data types as needed
Handle missing data and outliers appropriately
Check for data consistency and integrity

Day 3: Data Transformation

Transform the data to make it more suitable for modelling
Scale numerical features to a common range
Encode categorical features into numerical values
Create new features or combine existing ones to capture important information

Day 4: Modelling

Split the data into training and testing sets
Choose an appropriate regression model to fit the data
Train the model on the training set and tune its hyperparameters
Evaluate the model's performance on the testing set using appropriate metrics
Interpret the model's coefficients and assess its predictive power

Day 5: Insights & Learnings

Summarize the key findings and insights from the project
Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the model and the data
Discuss potential directions for future work or extensions of the project
Present the results and findings in a clear and accessible way, using appropriate visualizations and explanations.
